ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Charles King.  I am a developer who was originally taught the "just enough" philosophy to development, and I am spending my days correcting that mistake.  I strive for mastery of all concepts that I learn, especially under the hood of fundamental concepts.  I originally started learning C# with .Net framework.  Last year I turned to MERN stack and I love javascript!  I love creating content, working collaboratively, and helping address intangible issues that plague rookie developers!
