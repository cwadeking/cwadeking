- 👋 Hi, I’m Charles King.  I am currently a developer and instructor at devCodeCamp.  I have had my repo private so students did not feel the need to copy or use my work
as their own.  Now that we are moving away from a C# based course, I am refining the work that I had not finished and opening up the repositories.  I'm looking to spend more time
bettering myself.
- 👀 I’m interested in all tech.  I originally learned C# with ASP.NET framework.  I have since expanded my skillset to include the MERN stack, and am working on making myself
better.  We are also now teaching our student's Python.  The applications I have created with Python I have not yet pushed to Github.  They may need to stay private for a while 
after I do.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about Python and expanding my horizons to include Django and Flask.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any projects that make a difference in this world.  Not just profitability and solving business problems, but something that will make impacts
on individuals and how they live their lives.
